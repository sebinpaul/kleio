Requirements Document: Mention Monitoring Platform (F5Bot Alternative)
🏷️ Project Name
Kleio

1. 📌 Overview
   This is a mention monitoring tool similar to F5Bot that allows users to track keywords on platforms like Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, and Linkedin. Users will receive email notifications whenever their keywords are mentioned in posts or comments.

The app consists of:

A Next.js frontend

A Java Spring Boot backend

MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) for data storage

Scheduled scraping jobs

Email alerts

2. 🧩 Key Features
   ✅ User Functionality
   Sign up / Login

Add, view, and delete keywords

View recent mention history (optional for MVP)

Receive email alerts for new keyword mentions

🚀 Platform Support (Initial)
Reddit — scrape posts & comments from public subreddits

Hacker News — use Algolia API to fetch latest content

Twitter - figure it out

Linkedin - figure it out

3. 🧱 Tech Stack
   Frontend
   Next.js (TypeScript)

Tailwind CSS / shadcn/ui

Axios for API calls

Auth token (JWT) stored via HTTP-only cookie

Backend
Spring Boot (Java 17+)

Spring Security (JWT)

Spring Data JPA or MongoRepository

Scheduled scraping using Spring’s @Scheduled

REST API for frontend

JavaMailSender (for email alerts)

Database
MongoDB (preferred for flexible schema)
(Optional: PostgreSQL if stricter typing preferred)

Other
Redis (optional, for deduplication + email queueing)

SendGrid / Resend / Mailgun (email service)

5. 🔁 System Flow
   Authentication
   JWT token-based auth using Spring Security

Frontend stores token in HTTP-only cookie

Keyword Flow
Users can manage (add/remove) keywords via dashboard

Backend stores user-keyword mapping

Scraping Scheduler
Java service polls Reddit/HN every X minutes

For each new post/comment:

Normalize content

Match against keywords using regex or full-text search

If new mention → persist + enqueue for email

Notification
Batch mentions per user and send via SMTP service

Email includes:

Keyword matched

Excerpt of text

Source (e.g., Reddit post)

Link to original post

6. 🧪 MVP Acceptance Criteria
   ✅ I can register and log in via UI

✅ I can add and remove keywords

✅ I receive emails when my keywords are mentioned

✅ I do not receive duplicate alerts for same mention

✅ I can view my keyword list in the dashboard

✅ System polls Reddit and HN every few minutes

✅ Basic error handling for failed scrapes and emails

8. ⏱️ Suggested Tasks
   Backend (Spring Boot)
   Setup Spring Boot project with security and JWT auth

Define models: User, Keyword, Mention

REST APIs: register, login, keyword CRUD

Reddit + HN scraper (scheduled)

Email notification system

Frontend (Next.js)
User auth: login, register

Keyword management UI

Dashboard for recent activity (optional)

API calls with token auth

9. 🛡️ Security & Performance
   Secure password hashing (BCrypt)

Rate limit scraping per domain

Cache recent scraped posts to avoid duplicate scans

Validate and sanitize user inputs

HTTP-only cookies to store tokens

10. 💡 Future Enhancements
    Slack/webhook integrations

Daily/weekly summary digests

Support more platforms: Twitter (X), LinkedIn, YouTube

Custom alert frequency settings

User roles (admin/mod)
