🏷️ Project Name
Kleio

1. 📌 Overview
Kleio is a mention monitoring tool (similar to F5Bot) that allows users to track specific keywords across online platforms like Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Whenever a keyword is detected, users receive email alerts with context and source links.

Core Components:
Next.js frontend

Django backend (Python)

MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) for data storage

Scheduled scraping jobs

Email notification system

User authentication via Clerk

2. 🧩 Key Features

✅ User Functionality
Sign up / Log in via Clerk

Add, view, and delete keywords

View recent mention history (optional for MVP)

Receive email notifications for keyword mentions

🚀 Platform Support (Initial)
Reddit – Scrape posts & comments from public subreddits

Hacker News – Use Algolia API to fetch latest posts

Twitter – (to be figured out)

LinkedIn – (to be figured out)

3. 🧱 Tech Stack

Frontend
Next.js (TypeScript)

Tailwind CSS / shadcn/ui

Axios for API communication

Clerk for user auth (OAuth/email/password)

Backend
Django (Python 3.10+)

Django Rest Framework (DRF) for APIs

Django Q / Celery for scheduled scraping jobs

Email integration via SMTP or third-party API

Authentication handled by Clerk – use Clerk JWT for user ID mapping

Database
MongoDB (preferred for flexible schema)
(Optional: PostgreSQL if stricter typing or relational data is needed)

Other
Redis (optional, for deduplication, async queueing)

SendGrid / Resend / Mailgun for emails

5. 🔁 System Flow
🔐 Authentication (via Clerk)
Clerk manages user sign up, login, and session

Clerk JWT used to verify frontend → backend requests

Backend maps Clerk user_id to user data and keywords

🔍 Keyword Flow
Users manage keywords via frontend dashboard

Backend stores mapping of user → keyword list

🕒 Scraping Scheduler
Django background task polls Reddit and Hacker News every X minutes

Each post/comment is:

Normalized

Checked for matching keywords (regex or full-text search)

If matched: save mention and queue for email

✉️ Notification
Batch mentions per user

Format alert with:

Keyword matched

Excerpt text

Source (Reddit/HN)

Link to original post

Send via SMTP or email provider

6. 🧪 MVP Acceptance Criteria
✅ I can sign up and log in using Clerk

✅ I can add/remove keywords from the dashboard

✅ I receive emails when a keyword is mentioned

✅ I do not get duplicate emails for the same mention

✅ I can view my current keyword list

✅ System polls Reddit and HN regularly

✅ Basic error handling is in place

8. ⏱️ Suggested Tasks
Backend (Django)
Setup Django project & DRF API

Integrate Clerk JWT middleware for user verification

Define models: User, Keyword, Mention

Implement APIs for keyword CRUD

Scheduled scraping tasks (Reddit + HN)

Normalize text + match keywords

Email notification queue + sender service

Frontend (Next.js)
Integrate Clerk for authentication

UI to manage keywords (add/delete)

Display current keyword list

Trigger API calls with Clerk auth

(Optional) Display recent mentions

9. 🛡️ Security & Performance
Clerk handles password/auth security

Sanitize and validate user inputs

Avoid duplicate notifications with mention hashing

Rate-limit scrapers per source

Secure email transport

Use secure cookies or headers for Clerk JWT (if backend auth needed)

10. 💡 Future Enhancements
Slack or webhook integrations

Daily/weekly summary digests

Additional platforms: Twitter (X), LinkedIn, YouTube

Custom alert frequency or keyword rules

Admin/moderator dashboard

Team-based keyword tracking
